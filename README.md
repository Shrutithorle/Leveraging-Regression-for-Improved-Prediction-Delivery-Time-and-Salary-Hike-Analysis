# Project Title: Leveraging Regression for Improved Prediction: Delivery Time and Salary Hike Analysis

## Description:
This repository contains the code for a Python project implementing a linear regression model. The model is trained on delivery_time and Salary_data.
Built a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and make necessary transformations and selected the best model using Python.

## Key Features:
     * Implements the linear regression algorithm using  libraries - pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib.
     * Performs data preprocessing and feature engineering.
     * Evaluates model performance using coeffient, intercept and r square.
     * Provides visual aids for understanding the model behavior.
    
## There are two datasets in zip file format- 
1. Delivery Time 
	Objective  - Is to predict the Delivery time using Sorting time

2. Salary Hike
	Objective -  Is to build a prediction model for Salary Hike.
